= Installing from source =
If you have experience with the shell prompt and possibly a bit of Python you might want to install the development version to gain early access to new features. Since that version is constantly used in cron jobs, chances that it is unstable at any point in time are slim. Please *monitor the [http://code.google.com/p/pyroscope/source/list SVN log] and the [http://code.google.com/p/pyroscope/source/browse/trunk/debian/changelog changelog]* if you run from source.

For a working installation, you have to meet these requirements first:
 * Python 2.5 or a higher 2.x version (2.6 is recommended).
 * A proper build environment and a subversion + git client. On Debian and Ubuntu, you'll need the following packages installed (if there are packages missing from that list, please leave a comment):
{{{
aptitude install python python-dev build-essential subversion git
}}}
 * For `rtcontrol` and `rtxmlrpc`, an existing rTorrent installation, _with the xmlrpc option compiled in_ and the `scgi_local` or `scgi_port` command added to your `~/.rtorrent.rc`.
 * Using rTorrent *0.9.2*, *0.8.9* or *0.8.6* is recommended — PyroScope _should_ work together with older versions though, up to a point.

Initial installation to `~/lib/pyroscope` is as follows (do *NOT* do this as `root` or using `sudo`):
{{{
# To be executed in a shell with your normal user account!
mkdir -p ~/bin ~/lib
svn checkout http://pyroscope.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ ~/lib/pyroscope
~/lib/pyroscope/update-to-head.sh
# pass "/usr/bin/python2" or whatever to the script, if "/usr/bin/python" is not a suitable version
}}}

After that, the CommandLineTools are available in the `~/lib/pyroscope/bin` directory, and also added to your user's bin directory. And yes, this requires you to [http://linux.about.com/od/linux101/l/blnewbie3_1_4.htm add ~/bin to your PATH], if you didn't do that yet. To finish installation, read the next section.

= Completing your setup =
After installation, you *must change your `rtorrent.rc`* using the instructions on the UserConfiguration page, else many features of `rtcontrol` won't work as expected. You should at least *create a configuration* as described there, using the `pyroadmin --create-config` command. If you encounter any problems during installation not covered by the documentation, subscribe to the [http://groups.google.com/group/pyroscope-users pyroscope-users] mailing list to get help from the community, or join the inofficial <a href="irc://irc.freenode.net/rtorrent">`##rtorrent`</a> channel on `irc.freenode.net`.

         When the download is completed and before user post-processing,
         SAB chmod-s all files with the specified pattern (e.g. "o=rx, g=rx").
         Files that have no "u=x" will get no "g=x" or "o=x" bits!

added:   Email notifications (end of job and disk-full)
         Supports secured email (TLS) for use with gmail.com

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
changed: Now supports V3.newzbin.com and DirectNzb (by Freaky)

         Option "original folder' from 0.2.6 is gone!
added:   You can now set the RSS checking interval to 1/2/3/4 times/hour
         Set the proper value in the Configuration.
changed: Modified versions of Nova_0.3.2 and Nova_0.4.4 included
         set the proper path in SABnzbd.ini
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
0.2.6 by the ShyPike
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
added: Dirscan-speed in seconds (configurable).
changed: Increase server timeout to 120 (required by many providers)
       Needed to hard-code this. Change it to your required value.
       The change is in newswrapper.py, line 15.
added: Option to automatically refresh the Queue web page.
added: favicon in all templates
fixed: incorrect handling of server without port-spec
       (SABnzbd.ini.sample was incorrect)
added: Automatic refresh for connection-info, useful for troubleshooting.
added: Added more end-of-download script handling.
       To each option (R, U and D) a script option is added.
       After (correct) execution of the R, U or D, a single script is run.
       The script is specified in the "Directories" configuration.
       The additional NZB paramater "script" is passed on in each structure and call
       where now only "repair, unpack, delete" were passed/added.
       The templates have been modfied to give 3 additional processing choices
       "R+Script", "U+Script" and "D+Script".
       "None+Script" would not be very useful and is not implemented.
added: Add option to restore original folder names, derived from the NZB name,
       so that spaces and special characters are restored.
       Need not really be an option, but done so to keep compatibility.
added: Added special handling for multi-part archives that start with an EXE-file
       (so self-unpacking archives).
       You don't want to run the self-unpacker (coming from Internet!),
       but UnRar does not handle this situation correct.
       Therefore the script renames the EXE file to RAR and then lets UnRar do its work.
fixed: Make SABnzbd compatible with the new Newzbin RSS-feed.
       (Source: http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1795210&forum_id=498261)
